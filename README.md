# ml-notebooks
This repo is inspired by [Uva DL notebook](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

I would follow the same structure as Uva DL notebook but with my own implementation and some additional features.
Most notebooks are based on [Tutorial 9: Deep Autoencoders](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial9/AE_CIFAR10.html)
